# Tests Directory

This directory will contain global test configurations and fixtures once they are implemented.

## Purpose

- Store test configurations that apply across multiple components
- Maintain test fixtures and mock data
- Configure testing frameworks and tools

## Usage

Component-specific tests should be co-located with the components in `/src/components/[ComponentName]/`. Only global test configurations and shared test utilities belong in this directory.
