# PlayerCard Implementation Package for Claude 3.7 Sonnet

This package contains all necessary information for implementing the PlayerCard component for the Zenjin Maths App rebuild project using the Fractal AI-Assisted Development Framework.

## Implementation Goal

Implement the PlayerCard component that presents questions with binary choices and provides appropriate visual feedback based on user responses, following the distinction-based learning principles.

## Component Context

The PlayerCard is the core interactive element of the Zenjin Maths App's user interface. It presents mathematical questions with binary choices (one correct answer and one distractor) and provides visual feedback based on user responses. This component is central to implementing the distinction-based learning principles that form the theoretical foundation of the application.

## Technical Requirements

- Use Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Ensure the component is responsive and works well on mobile devices
- Implement smooth animations for feedback
- Ensure accessibility for school-aged children (6+ years old)
- Use dark theme to limit battery cost on mobile devices

## Implementation Prompt

You are implementing the PlayerCard component for the Zenjin Maths App, which is the core interactive element that presents mathematical questions with binary choices (one correct answer and one distractor) and provides visual feedback based on user responses.

The PlayerCard must:
1. Present questions with two possible answers in a visually appealing way
2. Show appropriate feedback:
   - Correct Answer: Circle glows greenish
   - Wrong Answer: Card shudders and circle glows reddish
   - No Answer: Answer circles go neutral blue and question repeats
   - Timeout: Handle when learner loses focus/gets distracted
3. Implement the PlayerCardInterface as defined in the UserInterface module
4. Support the distinction-based learning principles

Technical requirements:
- Use Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Ensure the component is responsive and works well on mobile devices
- Implement smooth animations for feedback
- Ensure accessibility for school-aged children (6+ years old)
- Use dark theme to limit battery cost on mobile devices

Please implement the PlayerCard component with all necessary TypeScript types, React hooks, and styling. Include comprehensive comments explaining the implementation details and how they relate to the distinction-based learning principles.

## Mock Inputs for Testing

```javascript
const mockQuestion = {
  id: "mult-7-8-001",
  text: "What is 7 Ã— 8?",
  correctAnswer: "56",
  distractor: "54",
  boundaryLevel: 5,
  factId: "mult-7-8"
};
```

## Expected Outputs

```javascript
const expectedResponse = {
  questionId: "mult-7-8-001",
  selectedAnswer: "56",
  isCorrect: true,
  responseTime: 1250,
  isFirstAttempt: true
};
```

## Validation Criteria

1. PlayerCard must show greenish glow for correct answers, reddish glow with card shudder for incorrect answers, and neutral blue for no-answer scenarios.
2. All UI components must consistently apply the theme with rich colors, gradients, and dark theme.
3. UI must be accessible for the target audience of school-aged children from age 6 and up.
4. All animations must maintain 60fps on target devices.
5. UI must respond to user interactions within 50ms.

## Distinction-Based Learning Principles (Context)

The PlayerCard implements the core principle of distinction-based learning by presenting binary choices that highlight the boundary between correct and incorrect mathematical concepts. The visual feedback reinforces these boundaries through clear, consistent visual cues that help learners internalize the distinctions.

The five boundary levels (represented by the `boundaryLevel` field in the Question structure) correspond to increasing levels of subtlety in the distinctions being tested:
- Level 1: Obvious distinctions (e.g., 2+2=4 vs 2+2=5)
- Level 2: Clear distinctions (e.g., 7Ã—8=56 vs 7Ã—8=64)
- Level 3: Moderate distinctions (e.g., 7Ã—8=56 vs 7Ã—8=54)
- Level 4: Subtle distinctions (e.g., 7Ã—8=56 vs 7Ã—8=57)
- Level 5: Very subtle distinctions (e.g., âˆš64=8 vs âˆš64=Â±8)

The PlayerCard should adapt its presentation based on the boundary level to support the learner's progression through increasingly subtle distinctions.
