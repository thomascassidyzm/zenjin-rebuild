  <ImplementationDetails>
    <Detail category="StorageStrategy">
      The FactRepository uses an in-memory map data structure for storing facts, with indexing to optimize retrieval operations. The implementation is designed to be extendable to persistent storage in the future.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="FactOrganization">
      Facts are organized by operation type, and each fact contains its relationship to other facts. This organization allows for efficient retrieval by operation and relationship type.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="QueryCapabilities">
      The implementation provides a flexible query mechanism that supports filtering by operation, difficulty level, tags, and other criteria. This enables other components to retrieve facts based on specific learning needs.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="PerformanceOptimization">
      The implementation includes caching mechanisms for frequently accessed facts and batch retrieval capabilities for efficient operations on sets of related facts.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="ErrorHandling">
      Comprehensive error handling is implemented, with specific error codes for different failure scenarios (fact not found, invalid query parameters, etc.).
    </Detail>
  </ImplementationDetails>
  
  <FunctionalRequirements>
    <Requirement id="FR-001" description="Store and retrieve mathematical facts by ID" status="implemented">
      <Implementation>
        Facts are stored in a map with their IDs as keys, allowing for O(1) lookup time. The getFact and getFactById methods provide direct access to facts by their unique identifiers.

    </Requirement>
    <Requirement id="FR-003" description="Identify related facts based on relationship type" status="implemented">
      <Implementation>
        Each fact maintains references to related facts with relationship types. The getRelatedFacts method retrieves facts based on their relationship to a given fact.
