  <ImplementationDetails>
    <Detail category="Architecture">
      The ContentManager is implemented as a layer on top of the FactRepository, providing higher-level administrative functions while delegating core storage operations to the repository.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="CurriculumManagement">
      Curriculum sets are managed as collections of facts with metadata, stored in a dedicated structure within the ContentManager. Import and export operations handle JSON serialization and deserialization.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="RelationshipGeneration">
      The implementation includes algorithms for automatically detecting and generating four types of relationships: commutative, inverse, adjacent, and equivalent. These algorithms analyze fact properties to establish connections.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="DifficultyCalculation">
      Two algorithms are implemented for calculating fact difficulty: a simple algorithm based on operand size and operation complexity, and a more sophisticated cognitive load algorithm that considers pattern recognition and conceptual complexity.
    </Detail>
    <Detail category="ErrorHandling">
      Comprehensive error handling is implemented using the ContentManagerErrorCode enum, with specific error codes for different failure scenarios and validation issues.
    </Detail>
  </ImplementationDetails>
