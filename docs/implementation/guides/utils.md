# Utils Directory

This directory will contain shared utility functions and helpers once they are implemented.

## Purpose

- Store utility functions that are used across multiple components
- Maintain helper classes and functions
- Provide common functionality like date formatting, data validation, etc.

## Usage

Only genuinely reusable utilities should be placed here. Component-specific utilities should be co-located with their components in `/src/components/[ComponentName]/`.
