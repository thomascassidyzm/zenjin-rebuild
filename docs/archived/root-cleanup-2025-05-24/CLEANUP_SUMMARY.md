# Root Folder Cleanup - 2025-05-24

## Files Moved from Root to Archive

The following files were cluttering the project root and have been moved to `docs/archived/root-cleanup-2025-05-24/`:

### Historical Handoff Documents
- `HANDOFF_NEXT_CHAT.apml` - Previous chat session handoff
- `PROJECT_HANDOFF.apml` - Old project handoff document  
- `PROJECT_HANDOFF_BACKEND_SERVICES.apml` - Backend services specific handoff
- `QUICK_HANDOFF.md` - Quick reference (superseded by current README)

### Development Documentation (Historical)
- `SOLUTION_ANALYSIS.md` - Historical solution analysis
- `TYPESCRIPT_GUIDE.md` - TypeScript guidance (now in docs/build/)
- `TypeScript_Fixes.md` - Historical TypeScript fixes
- `PROGRESS_REPORT.md` - Old progress tracking (superseded by registry.apml)

### Project Structure Files (Historical)
- `framework_relationships.md` - Framework relationships (now in docs/)
- `knowledge_transfer.md` - Knowledge transfer (superseded by current docs/)

### Status/Display Files (Historical)
- `status.html` - Old status dashboard (superseded by ProjectStatusDashboard)

**Note:** `index.html` was initially moved but then restored to root as it's required for Vite build process.

## Files Remaining in Root

**Essential Project Files:**
- `README.md` - **Primary project documentation**
- `registry.apml` - **Single source of truth for component status**
- `apml_framework_v1.3.3.md` - **Current APML Framework specification**
- `APML_EXPLAINER.md` - **APML methodology overview**
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - **Vercel deployment instructions**

## Rationale

The root folder cleanup follows these principles:
1. **Keep only essential, current documentation in root**
2. **Archive historical/superseded files with date organization**
3. **Maintain clear project entry point with README.md**
4. **Preserve all files for historical reference**

## Result

✅ **Clean, focused root directory**  
✅ **Clear project entry point via README.md**  
✅ **All historical files preserved in dated archive**  
✅ **Improved project navigation and onboarding**
