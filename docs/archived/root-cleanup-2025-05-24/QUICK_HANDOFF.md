# Zenjin Maths App - Quick Handoff Reference

**Last Updated:** May 23, 2025  
**Project Status:** 80% complete, spaced repetition working  
**Framework:** APML v1.3.2  

## 🎯 Recent Major Win (May 23, 2025)
✅ **Spaced repetition algorithm fully implemented and working!**
- Fixed sequence [4,8,15,30,100,1000] 
- Positions-as-first-class-citizens architecture
- Perfect/Imperfect completion rules working
- No more "No stitches available" errors

## 📁 Essential Files to Know
- `/registry.apml` - Single source of truth for all component status
- `/README.md` - Project overview with current status  
- `/src/engines/EngineOrchestrator.ts` - Central coordination
- `/src/engines/SpacedRepetitionSystem/SpacedRepetitionSystem.ts` - Recently fixed algorithm
- `/src/App.tsx` - Testing buttons and main integration

## 🚦 Module Status Overview
| Module | Status | Priority | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| UserInterface | 🟢 integrated (95%) | Low | Mobile accessibility |
| LearningEngine | 🟠 functional (85%) | Medium | Admin tools |
| ProgressionSystem | 🟠 functional (85%) | Low | ✅ Working! |
| MetricsSystem | 🟠 functional (90%) | Medium | Global ranking |
| SubscriptionSystem | 🟡 scaffolded (65%) | Medium | Payment integration |
| OfflineSupport | 🟡 scaffolded (60%) | **HIGH** | Missing interfaces |
| UserManagement | 🟠 functional (90%) | Low | - |
| Orchestration | 🟠 functional (85%) | Low | ✅ Working! |

## 🔥 Next High Priority Steps
1. **Implement ConnectivityManagerInterface** (OfflineSupport) - Critical missing piece
2. **Add conflict resolution** to SynchronizationManager - Essential for multi-device
3. **Replace mock PaymentProcessor** - Required for production

## 🧪 Quick Testing
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Use Perfect (20/20) / Imperfect (15/20) buttons
3. Check console logs for spaced repetition behavior
4. Should see skip numbers: 4 → 8 → 15 → 30 → 100 → 1000

## 📊 Status Tracking System
- 🔴 not-started → 🟡 scaffolded → 🟠 functional → 🟢 integrated → 🔵 tested → ⭐ optimized

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions
- **Interface-first development** throughout
- **Spaced repetition** with fixed scientific sequence
- **Positions-as-first-class-citizens** for scalable content management
- **6-phase status tracking** for quality assurance
