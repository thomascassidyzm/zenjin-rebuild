- Business logic components in `/src/engines/`
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Consistent file naming and organization
- Comprehensive documentation for each component

## Documentation Status

All implemented components have:
- Detailed README files
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Example usage files
- Validation criteria

## Conclusion

The Zenjin Maths App Rebuild project has been successfully completed, with all 21 planned components implemented. The project has met its objectives of creating a modular, maintainable implementation of the distinction-based learning system with improved component separation, interface clarity, and testability. The next phase will focus on testing, optimization, and preparation for deployment.
