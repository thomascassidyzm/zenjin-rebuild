    <RebuildJustification>
      The current implementation, while functional, has accumulated technical debt that makes further adaptation increasingly difficult. A rebuild using the Fractal AI-Assisted Development Framework would address these issues by enforcing clear interface boundaries, consistent implementation patterns, and testable components. The rebuild would preserve the strong theoretical foundation and effective user experience while improving maintainability and extensibility.
