# Registry Archive

## Purpose

This directory contains archived versions of the registry.apml file for historical reference. 

## Important Note

**The single source of truth for the project registry is the `registry.apml` file in the project root directory.**

This directory is **NOT** the source of truth for what needs to be built. It only contains historical snapshots of the registry for reference and tracking purposes.

## Contents

- `archive/`: Contains dated versions of the registry.apml file

## Naming Convention

Archived registry files follow this naming convention:
```
registry.apml.YYYY-MM-DD
```

Where YYYY-MM-DD is the date when the registry was archived.

## Do Not Use These Files For Development

Always refer to the root `/registry.apml` file for current development work. These archived files should only be used for historical analysis or troubleshooting.
