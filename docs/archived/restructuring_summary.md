# Project Restructuring Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Separated Framework from Project Files**
   - Framework directory now contains only the framework definition and documentation
   - Project-specific APML files have been moved to `/docs/build/apml/`

2. **Organized Build Artifacts**
   - Created structured directories for different types of build artifacts:
     - `/docs/build/apml/interfaces/` - Interface definitions
     - `/docs/build/apml/modules/` - Module definitions
     - `/docs/build/apml/sessions/` - Development sessions
     - `/docs/build/implementation_packages/` - LLM implementation instructions

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created `/docs/project_structure.md` with detailed explanation of project structure and file relationships
   - Updated README.md to reflect the new directory structure and implementation process

4. **Created Automation Script**
   - Added `/scripts/generate_implementation_package.sh` to automate the creation of implementation packages from APML files

## Purpose of Changes

These changes were made to:

1. **Clarify Separation of Concerns**
   - Framework definition is now separate from project-specific artifacts
   - Build artifacts are clearly distinguished from execution artifacts

2. **Improve Organization**
   - Related artifacts are grouped together in logical directories
   - Directory structure better reflects the workflow of the project

3. **Streamline Development Process**
   - Clear distinction between APML files (machine-readable specifications) and implementation packages (LLM-ready instructions)
   - Automation script to assist in generating implementation packages

## APML vs. Implementation Packages

The project now clearly distinguishes between two types of files:

1. **APML Files** (`/docs/build/apml/`)
   - XML format with strict schema
   - Machine-readable and amenable to tooling/automation
   - Single source of truth for project specifications
   - Used for tracking, documentation, and verification

2. **Implementation Packages** (`/docs/build/implementation_packages/`)
   - Markdown format for human and LLM readability
   - Derived from APML files but optimized for LLM consumption
   - Comprehensive instructions for component implementation
   - Includes context, requirements, prompts, examples, and validation criteria

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Automation Script**
   - Enhance the script to extract more information from APML files
   - Add support for updating existing implementation packages

2. **Update Existing Implementation Packages**
   - Ensure all existing implementation packages reference the correct file paths

3. **Continue Component Implementation**
   - Use the updated structure for implementing the next components (Dashboard, DistinctionManager, etc.)

4. **Document Process**
   - Add more detailed documentation about the implementation process using the new structure
