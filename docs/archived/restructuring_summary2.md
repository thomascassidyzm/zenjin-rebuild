# Project Restructuring Summary - Phase 2

This document summarizes the additional cleanup and optimization of the project structure conducted on May 20, 2025.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Duplicate Registry Files**
   - Archived `/docs/project/registry.apml` to `/archived_files/registry/`
   - Archived `/framework/phase1/ProjectRegistry.apml` to `/archived_files/registry/`
   - Kept only `/docs/project/registry/registry.apml` as the single source of truth

2. **Removed Duplicate Progress Files**
   - Archived `/docs/project/progress.apml` to `/archived_files/progress/`
   - Kept only `/docs/project/progress/progress.apml` as the single source of truth

3. **Reorganized Documentation Files**
   - Moved `/docs/knowledge_transfer.md` to `/docs/project/knowledge/knowledge_transfer.md`
   - Archived `/docs/todo.md` to `/archived_files/`
   - Moved `/docs/project_status.html` to `/archived_files/html/`

4. **Added READMEs for Empty Directories**
   - Added `/tests/README.md` explaining the purpose of the tests directory
   - Added `/src/engines/README.md` explaining the purpose and future contents of the engines directory
   - Added `/src/utils/README.md` explaining the purpose of the utils directory

5. **Improved Framework Directory**
   - Moved older `/framework/current/fractal_framework.md` to `/archived_files/framework/`
   - Kept only `/framework/current/fractal_framework_v1.2.1.md` as the single framework definition

6. **Added Documentation for Archived Files**
   - Created README files in all archived directories explaining what files were moved and why
   - Created `/docs/optimization_plan.md` documenting the restructuring process

7. **Updated Main README**
   - Updated file paths to reflect new structure
   - Added more detailed directory structure diagram
   - Added references to new documentation files

## Project Structure Principles

The restructuring was guided by the following principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Each artifact type has exactly one authoritative location
   - No duplicate files serving the same purpose

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Framework definition separate from project files
   - Build artifacts separate from execution artifacts
   - Active files separate from archived files

3. **Documentation for Future Reference**
   - Empty directories have README files explaining their purpose
   - Archived files have documentation explaining what they are and why they were archived

4. **Organized Directory Structure**
   - Logical grouping of related files
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Clear file paths that indicate purpose

## Files Moved to Archive

The following files were moved to the archive directory:

- `/docs/project/registry.apml` → `/archived_files/registry/`
- `/framework/phase1/ProjectRegistry.apml` → `/archived_files/registry/`
- `/docs/project/progress.apml` → `/archived_files/progress/`
- `/docs/todo.md` → `/archived_files/`
- `/docs/project_status.html` → `/archived_files/html/`
- `/framework/current/fractal_framework.md` → `/archived_files/framework/`

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the implementation of the Dashboard component
2. Begin work on the LearningEngine module components using the optimized project structure
3. Update the automation script to work with the new file paths
