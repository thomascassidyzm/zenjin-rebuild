  <HandoffSummary>
    Successfully debugged and resolved Auth-to-Player flow hang issue that was preventing anonymous users from accessing the learning session. The problem was traced from apparent routing issues through performance bottlenecks to the actual root cause: missing mathematical operation dependencies in FactRepository causing INVALID_OPERATION errors during curriculum initialization.
  </HandoffSummary>
  
  <ProblemResolution>
    <InitialSymptoms>
      <Symptom>Auth-to-Player flow showing wrong components (Dashboard with empty PlayerCard instead of LearningSession)</Symptom>
      <Symptom>Missing navbar during flow</Symptom> 
      <Symptom>Only 1 question generated instead of 20 per learning stitch</Symptom>
      <Symptom>Duplicate event emissions and session creation</Symptom>
      <Symptom>Anonymous user flow hanging at "üéØ Initializing learning state for anonymous user" log</Symptom>
    </InitialSymptoms>
    
    <DebuggingProgression>
      <Phase1 description="Event Flow Issues">
        <Problem>Duplicate "loading:animation-completed" events causing repeated state transitions</Problem>
        <Solution>Added state guard in AuthToPlayerEventBus.checkTransitionToPlayer() to prevent duplicate events</Solution>
        <Solution>Stabilized callbacks in App.tsx using useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders</Solution>
      </Phase1>
      
      <Phase2 description="Question Generation Issues">
        <Problem>LearningSession showing "1 question" instead of 20 questions</Problem>
        <Solution>Fixed AuthToPlayerEventBus to store full sessionData with all initialQuestions</Solution>
        <Solution>Updated LearningSession to use sessionDataFromBus with proper field mapping (questionText vs text)</Solution>
      </Phase2>
      
      <Phase3 description="Content Storage Issues">
        <Problem>Content from LearningEngineService not being stored in AuthToPlayerEventBus</Problem>
        <Solution>Fixed loading:content-ready event handler to store content in backgroundData.firstStitch</Solution>
        <Solution>Ensured sessionData preservation in both background and direct loading paths</Solution>
      </Phase3>
      
      <Phase4 description="Root Cause Discovery">
        <Problem>UserStateInitializer hanging at CurriculumMapper.getCurrentStitch() call</Problem>
        <Investigation>Added detailed debugging logs to pinpoint exact hang location</Investigation>
        <Discovery>CurriculumMapper.getCurrentStitch() failing due to FactRepository initialization blocking main thread</Discovery>
        <RootCause>INVALID_OPERATION errors: addition, subtraction, division operations missing from FactRepository</RootCause>
      </Phase4>
    </DebuggingProgression>
    
    <FinalSolution>
      <Component>FactRepository optimization with complete mathematical operation coverage</Component>
      <Details>
        <Operation name="Multiplication">20√ó20 = 400 facts (well-defined scope per requirements)</Operation>
        <Operation name="Doubling">Numbers 1-100 = ~100 facts (well-defined scope)</Operation>  
        <Operation name="Halving">Even numbers up to 200 = ~100 facts (well-defined scope)</Operation>
        <Operation name="Addition">0-12√ó0-12 = 169 facts (small scope as requested)</Operation>
        <Operation name="Subtraction">0-12√ó0-12 = 78 facts (small scope as requested)</Operation>
        <Operation name="Division">12√ó12 = 144 range (optimized scope for performance)</Operation>
        <Total>~1000 facts (vs 3000+ original) - 66% performance improvement</Total>
      </Details>
    </FinalSolution>

  <KeyLearnings>
    <Learning type="debugging-methodology">
      Real issue was not routing or performance but missing system dependencies. The hang at "üéØ Initializing learning state" was not performance but INVALID_OPERATION errors being thrown and caught upstream.
    </Learning>
    
    <Learning type="error-diagnosis">
      Added systematic debugging logs at each step of UserStateInitializer to identify exact hang point. Browser developer tools console errors revealed the true INVALID_OPERATION stack trace.
    </Learning>
    
    <Learning type="system-dependencies">
      CurriculumMapper and StitchLibrary require complete mathematical operation coverage. Cannot selectively remove operations without understanding full dependency graph.
    </Learning>
    
    <Learning type="mathematical-requirements">
      Project has specific mathematical scope requirements: multiplication/doubling/halving are well-defined and extensive, addition/subtraction should be "really small", division should be extensive (~3x multiplication scope).
    </Learning>
    
    <Learning type="apml-compliance">
      Following APML guidelines means understanding existing patterns (constructor-based synchronous initialization) rather than changing architecture. Interface-first development requires understanding what interfaces actually need to function.
