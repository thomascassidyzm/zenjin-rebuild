  <ArchitecturalDecisions>
    <Decision topic="Doubling/Halving as Mathematical Foundation">
      <Context>Traditional math curriculum starts with addition/subtraction, but this delays fractional thinking and multiplicative reasoning</Context>
      <Resolution>Doubling/halving becomes core foundation: automatically leads to fractions (half of 23 = 11.5), builds multiplicative intuition, enables seamless progression to multiplication tables</Resolution>
      <Rationale>Doubling/halving creates clearest distinction boundaries, builds pattern recognition over memorization, naturally introduces decimals and fractions</Rationale>
      <Impact>Revolutionary curriculum approach that accelerates mathematical intuition development and prepares for advanced concepts earlier</Impact>
    </Decision>
    
    <Decision topic="Live Aid Performance Architecture">
      <Context>Traditional learning apps compute questions on-demand, causing performance bottlenecks and wait times during learning</Context>
      <Resolution>Three-phase pipeline: PREPARING (background assembly), READY (cached content), LIVE (pure streaming). All computation happens in background.</Resolution>
      <Rationale>Netflix-like experience eliminates cognitive friction, ensures smooth flow state, allows complex content generation without user-facing delays</Rationale>
      <Impact>Transforms learning experience from computational to streaming, enables sophisticated content generation without performance sacrifice</Impact>
    </Decision>
    
    <Decision topic="Minimal Reading Paradigms">
      <Context>Traditional math problems use verbose language ("What is double 13?") creating unnecessary cognitive load</Context>
      <Resolution>Eliminate all unnecessary reading: "Double 13" not "What is double 13?", "19 × 4" not "19 × 4 = ?", algebra boxes instead of question marks</Resolution>
      <Rationale>Minimizes cognitive overhead, removes language barriers, enables pure mathematical thinking, universal across languages</Rationale>
      <Impact>Dramatically reduces cognitive load, enables focus on mathematical pattern recognition rather than language processing</Impact>
    </Decision>
    
    <Decision topic="Backwards Multiplication Confidence Building">
      <Context>Multiplication tables traditionally taught in ascending order (1×, 2×, 3×) which feels increasingly difficult</Context>
      <Resolution>Tube 2 starts with 19× table, works backwards to 3×. Binary distinctions make "hard" tables feel easy, builds confidence</Resolution>
      <Rationale>19× with binary choice becomes pattern recognition, learners feel they're doing advanced math, confidence builds as numbers get "easier"</Rationale>
      <Impact>Psychological advantage transforms multiplication learning from intimidating to empowering experience</Impact>
    </Decision>
    
    <Decision topic="Number Ending Complexity Classification">
      <Context>Mathematical complexity doesn't always correlate with number size - doubling 15 vs doubling 17 have different cognitive loads</Context>
      <Resolution>Group by number endings for complexity bands: 0/5 endings (easiest), 1-4 endings (medium), 6-9 endings (harder)</Resolution>
      <Rationale>Endings determine carrying/borrowing complexity in doubling/halving operations, creating natural cognitive difficulty levels</Rationale>
      <Impact>Enables coherent stitches with consistent cognitive load, improves learning flow and energy optimization</Impact>

        <Rationale>Builds multiplicative thinking, automatically introduces fractions, creates clearest distinction boundaries</Rationale>
        <TubeAllocation>Tube 1: ~20 stitches (10 doubling + 10 halving including half-numbers like 3.5)</TubeAllocation>
      </Concept>

        <Description>Multiplication tables taught in reverse order for psychological advantage</Description>
        <Progression>19× → 18× → 17× → ... → 3× (skipping 1× and 2× as trivial)</Progression>
        <Rationale>Binary distinctions make "hard" tables feel easy, builds confidence, learners feel advanced</Rationale>
        <TubeAllocation>Tube 2: 18 stitches (19× through 3×, 20 questions each = full times table)</TubeAllocation>
      </Concept>
      
      <Concept name="Division as Algebra Preparation">
        <Description>Division presented as inverse multiplication to build algebraic thinking</Description>
        <Progression>"What × 7 = 35?" instead of "35 ÷ 7 = ?", preparing for variable thinking</Progression>
        <Rationale>Sets up algebraic reasoning early, avoids division symbol confusion, builds inverse operation understanding</Rationale>
        <TubeAllocation>Tube 3: Similar count to other tubes with easy inverse relationships</TubeAllocation>
      </Concept>
      
      <Concept name="Strategic Addition/Subtraction">
        <Description>Addition/subtraction included strategically, not as foundation</Description>
        <Progression>~10% surprise stitches scattered across tubes, pattern-based (endings approach)</Progression>
        <Rationale>Politically necessary for parent/teacher acceptance, maintains cognitive disruption, not foundational</Rationale>
        <TubeAllocation>Distributed across all tubes as surprise elements to prevent automation</TubeAllocation>
