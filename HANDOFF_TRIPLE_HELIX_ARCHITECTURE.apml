  <RecentChanges>
    <Change date="2025-05-26" type="architecture-correction" impact="major">
      <Summary>Corrected Triple Helix architecture from 8-tube linear to proper 3-tube rotation system</Summary>
      <Details>
        Replaced UserCurriculumPosition with UserTripleHelixPosition. Implemented proper tube rotation (1→2→3→1...) with stitch groupings loaded by concept. Updated CurriculumMapper to organize content into 3 tubes with proper prerequisite chains. Users now have positions in each tube rather than advancing through tubes linearly.
      </Details>
      <ValidationResults>Architecture validates correctly, user state initialization working, content properly organized by concept</ValidationResults>
    </Change>
    
    <Change date="2025-05-26" type="bug-fix" impact="high">
      <Summary>Fixed keyboard input bug in OTP email form</Summary>
      <Details>
        Moved nested EmailEntryForm, OTPVerificationForm, and ErrorState components outside main component to prevent re-creation on every render. Added autoFocus and proper component separation. This fixes the critical UX bug where keyboard would dismiss after each character on mobile.
      </Details>
      <ValidationResults>Email input now maintains focus properly, mobile experience significantly improved</ValidationResults>
    </Change>
    
    <Change date="2025-05-26" type="architecture-improvement" impact="medium">
      <Summary>Replaced useAuthToPlayerFlow hook with event-driven AuthToPlayerEventBus</Summary>
      <Details>
        Implemented event-driven architecture for Auth-to-Player flow using explicit event dispatching and handling. This provides better separation of concerns, easier testing, and clearer data flow. Events include state transitions, background loading, and content preparation.
      </Details>
      <ValidationResults>Flow works correctly with clear event logs, easier to debug and maintain</ValidationResults>
