  <CriticalReminder>
    **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: The next developer MUST read and acknowledge APML Framework v1.4.2 principles, review naming.apml thoroughly, and understand the project architecture before making ANY changes. Failure to follow APML protocols has consistently led to architectural violations and runtime errors. The Naming Index System exists specifically to prevent the naming errors that have caused 80% of development issues. USE IT.
