      <Summary>APML-Compliant Session State Transition Service Implementation</Summary>
      <Details>
        Created SessionStateTransitionInterface.apml defining interface contracts for managing authentication state transitions. Implemented SessionStateTransitionService.ts as APML-compliant service adapter that prevents UI flashing during anonymous user creation. Updated App.tsx to use proper interface-first rendering logic that checks for both authenticated users and users in transition. Fixed timing gap between anonymous user authentication and Auth-to-Player flow initialization.
