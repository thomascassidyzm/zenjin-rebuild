## Out of Scope (Don't Spend Time On)

- ❌ Accessibility compliance (separate project)

## Context for Agent

This is about getting "good enough to launch" compliance documentation by copying what works in the industry. Speed over perfection. We want to protect users and our business without getting bogged down in legal complexity.

**Key Philosophy**: Copy the best, adapt for our context, iterate based on real usage.
