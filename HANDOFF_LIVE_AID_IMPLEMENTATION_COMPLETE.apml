  <DevelopmentConstraints>
    <MandatoryReadingComprehension>
      Before making ANY changes, the AI assistant must:
      1. Read LIVE_AID_IMPLEMENTATION_ALGORITHMS.apml for explicit algorithmic specifications
      2. Understand Live Aid architecture: background preparation, instant caching, zero-wait streaming
      3. Respect doubling/halving curriculum foundation (NOT addition/subtraction base)
      4. Use TodoWrite tool to plan work BEFORE executing any changes
    </MandatoryReadingComprehension>
    
    <ForbiddenActions>
      - Breaking the PREPARING → READY → LIVE performance model
      - Reverting to synchronous question generation during LIVE phase
      - Changing curriculum foundation from doubling/halving to addition/subtraction
      - Creating test/demo files (removed per APML cleanup)
      - Violating minimal reading paradigms ("Double 13", "19 × 4", "□ × 7 = 35")

  <ArchitecturalDecisions>
    <Decision topic="Netflix-like Streaming Performance">
      <Context>Traditional learning apps compute questions on-demand causing delays and poor user experience</Context>
      <Resolution>Three-phase pipeline: PREPARING (background), READY (cached), LIVE (pure streaming)</Resolution>
      <Rationale>Eliminates all computation during learning sessions, ensures smooth flow state, enables complex content without performance sacrifice</Rationale>
      <Impact>Revolutionary user experience with zero-wait content delivery and sophisticated background preparation</Impact>
    </Decision>
    
    <Decision topic="Doubling/Halving Curriculum Foundation">
      <Context>Traditional math starts with addition/subtraction, delaying multiplicative thinking and fractional understanding</Context>
      <Resolution>Doubling/halving as core foundation with number ending complexity progression (0/5 → 1-4 → 6-9)</Resolution>
      <Rationale>Builds multiplicative intuition from start, naturally introduces fractions, creates clearest distinction boundaries</Rationale>
      <Impact>Accelerated mathematical intuition development and preparation for advanced concepts</Impact>
