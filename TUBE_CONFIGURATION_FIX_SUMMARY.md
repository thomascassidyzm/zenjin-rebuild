# Tube Configuration Architecture Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
**Error:** `INVALID_CONCEPT_CODE: Concept 0001 not in tube2`

**Root Cause:** Hardcoded concept-to-tube mappings in StitchPopulation prevented concepts from being used in different tubes, violating the L1 strategic vision that tubes are flexible content streams.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `database/add_default_tube_positions.sql`

Added two new tables:
- `default_tube_positions`: Maps tube positions to stitches and concepts
- `concept_tube_mappings`: Flexible many-to-many mapping of concepts to tubes

Also added columns to `user_state`:
- `tube_positions`: JSONB column for user's current tube positions
- `active_tube`: Integer for currently active tube

### 2. StitchPopulation Engine Updates
**File:** `src/engines/StitchPopulation/StitchPopulation.ts`

Changes:
- Added `conceptTubeMappings` property for flexible mappings
- Modified `getConceptMapping()` to be async and support any concept in any tube
- Added `initializeConceptTubeMappings()` method
- Integrated with new `ConceptMappingService`

Key change in `getConceptMapping()`:
```typescript
// Always return the mapping with the requested tube
return {
  ...mapping,
  tubeId: tubeId  // Use the requested tube, not hardcoded
};
```

### 3. New Concept Mapping Service
**File:** `src/services/ConceptMappingService.ts`

Created new service to:
- Load concept-to-tube mappings from database
- Check if concepts are allowed in specific tubes
- Cache mappings for performance
- Support the L1 vision of flexible tube assignments

### 4. Interface Update
**File:** `src/interfaces/StitchPopulationInterface.ts`

Changed `getConceptMapping()` signature to return `Promise<ConceptMapping>` to support async database checks.

### 5. Test Plan Documentation
**File:** `docs/test-plans/tube-configuration-fix-test-plan.md`

Comprehensive test plan covering:
- Database migration testing
- Flexible concept mapping validation
- Service integration tests
- End-to-end learning session tests

## Key Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Any concept can now be assigned to any tube
2. **Database-Driven**: Curriculum designers can configure tube assignments via database
3. **L1 Vision Alignment**: Tubes are now truly flexible content streams
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing mappings continue to work as defaults
5. **Performance**: Caching prevents excessive database queries

## Example: Concept 0001 in Multiple Tubes

The fix specifically addresses the reported error by allowing concept "0001" to appear in both tube1 (its default) and tube2:

```sql
-- In default_tube_positions
('tube2', 18, 'stitch_t2_p18', '0001', 'doubling_0_5_endings_1')

-- In concept_tube_mappings  
('0001', 'tube1', true),   -- Default tube
('0001', 'tube2', false)   -- Also allowed in tube2
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Apply database migration:
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f database/add_default_tube_positions.sql
   ```

2. Run test suite focusing on tube configuration:
   ```bash
   npm test -- tube-configuration
   ```

3. Verify concept 0001 works in tube2:
   ```typescript
   const mapping = await stitchPopulation.getConceptMapping('0001', 'tube2');
   // Should not throw error
   ```

## Notes

- The system now logs when concepts are dynamically allowed in tubes
- All concepts can be used in any tube, even if not explicitly mapped
- Performance impact is minimal due to caching
- Future enhancement: Admin UI for managing concept-to-tube mappings
