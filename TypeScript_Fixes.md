# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **QuestionGenerator.test.ts**
   - Fixed syntax errors at lines 487, 616, and 629
   - Properly organized the tests into the appropriate describe/it blocks
   - Corrected an issue with a test case that was outside of any describe block
   - Fixed incomplete code (`mockFactRepository.getFactsBy` was incomplete)

2. **SessionMetricsManagerUnitTests.ts**
   - Fixed structure with closing braces
   - Corrected out-of-place describe blocks
   - Reorganized the test structure to ensure proper nesting

3. **ContentManager.ts**
   - No syntax errors were found in this file
   - The file is now correctly formatted and passes the TypeScript syntax check

## Remaining Issues

1. **Test Framework Type Errors**
   - Both files still have TypeScript errors related to missing Jest type definitions
   - Error: `Cannot find name 'describe'. Do you need to install type definitions for a test runner? Try npm i --save-dev @types/jest or npm i --save-dev @types/mocha.`
   - Solution: Install Jest type definitions with `npm install --save-dev @types/jest`

2. **Module Import Errors**
   - SessionMetricsManagerUnitTests.ts has an error importing `./session-metrics-manager`
   - Error: `Cannot find module './session-metrics-manager' or its corresponding type declarations.`
   - Solution: Verify the correct path to the SessionMetricsManager implementation file

3. **Other TypeScript Errors**
   - Various other TypeScript errors exist throughout the codebase
   - These will need to be addressed one by one as needed
   - Mostly related to missing type definitions and `any` types

## Next Steps

1. Install Jest type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/jest
   ```

2. Fix module import paths:
   - Ensure `session-metrics-manager.ts` exists in the correct location
   - Fix import paths in test files

3. Address other TypeScript errors as needed:
   - Add missing type definitions
   - Replace `any` types with proper types
   - Fix other type-related issues

The build errors that were preventing compilation have been fixed, but a complete solution would involve addressing the remaining TypeScript errors.
