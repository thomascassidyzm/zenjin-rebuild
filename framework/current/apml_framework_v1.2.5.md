## Core Concept: A Programmatic Checklist Approach

This framework transforms AI-assisted development from an ad-hoc process into a structured program that humans execute with AI assistance. Following the Checklist Manifesto approach, it provides a precise sequence of steps that ensure consistent, high-quality outcomes while working within AI system constraints.

## Core Principles for Non-Coders

The framework emphasizes three core principles for non-coders:

1. **Better × Simpler × Cheaper**: All decisions should optimize for this combination, making development more accessible.
2. **Approachable Testing**: Testing should be simple enough for non-coders to verify component functionality.
3. **Minimal Tooling**: Rely on simple, widely available tools rather than complex development environments.

## Foundations: AI Project Markup Language (APML)

The framework is built upon AI Project Markup Language (APML) - a formal structural language designed specifically for human-AI collaboration. APML exists in three forms:

1. **Standard APML** - Complete XML representation for storage, documentation, and tools (single source of truth)
2. **Markdown APML** - Human-readable representation for review and verification
3. **Token-Optimized APML** - Compact representation for AI session contexts

## Axioms

### Axiom 1: Complete Context Boundaries
All entities must have explicitly defined context boundaries that fit within AI token limitations.

### Axiom 2: Interface Before Implementation
Interfaces must be fully specified before implementation begins.

### Axiom 3: Single-Session Completability
All defined tasks must be completable within a single AI session's context limits.

### Axiom 4: Explicit Knowledge Capture
All decisions and rationales must be explicitly documented for future sessions.

### Axiom 5: Validation Through Distinction
All implementations must be validated through explicit test-linked criteria.

## Multi-LLM Component Architecture

The framework employs a "prefabricated components" approach where different AI systems can implement isolated components that connect through well-defined interfaces:

### 1. Interface Contracts Define Boundaries
- Each component has a clearly defined interface (inputs/outputs/behaviors)
- These interfaces act as contracts that implementations must fulfill
- Components interact only through their defined interfaces

### 2. Independent Implementation
- Different AI systems can implement different components
- The same AI can implement multiple components in isolation
- Each implementation focuses only on its specific responsibilities

### 3. Strategic AI Assignment
| Component Type | Recommended AI | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| UI Components | Claude Pro | Consistent design approach and user experience |
| Core Algorithms | Claude Code | Complex reasoning and educational algorithm expertise |
| Data Models | Gemini/GPT | Structured data handling capabilities |
| State Management | Claude Pro | Consistent approach to state handling |
| Security Layer | Security-focused prompt | Consistent security implementation |

### 4. System Requirements in Interfaces

```xml
<Interface name="ComponentName">
  <!-- Standard interface definition -->
  
  <SystemRequirements>
    <Requirement type="Performance" name="ResponseTime">
      Must execute within 100ms
    </Requirement>
    <Requirement type="Security" name="DataValidation">
      Must validate all input data against XSS attacks
    </Requirement>
  </SystemRequirements>
  
  <StateInteractions>
    <SharedState name="StateName" access="read-write" />
  </StateInteractions>
</Interface>
```

## Process Flow: The Human-AI Program

The framework structures AI-assisted development as a deterministic sequence of steps humans follow with AI assistance:

## Phase 0N: New Project Inception & Definition (For New Projects)

### Purpose
To thoroughly define the context, objectives, scope, and critical parameters for a brand-new software project, ensuring a solid foundation for AI-assisted development using the APML framework. This phase ensures that the "why" and "what" are deeply understood before moving to "how."

### Applicability Rules
- This phase is mandatory for all new projects that are not direct rebuilds of existing systems.
- Should be executed before Phase 0 (Framework Initialization) and Phase 1 (Project Registry Creation).

### Steps
1. **Define Problem & Opportunity:** Document the specific problem, need, target audience, current solutions, and unique value proposition.
2. **Outline Solution Vision & Objectives:** Describe the core concept, key functionalities, long-term vision, and SMART objectives for the initial version.
3. **Identify Users & Stakeholders:** Define primary user personas and key internal/external stakeholders, along with their needs and expectations.
4. **Establish Initial Scope & Boundaries:** Detail essential features for the MVP (in-scope) and explicitly deferred features (out-of-scope), plus known dependencies/integrations.
5. **Document Constraints & Assumptions:** List known budget, time, technology, legal, and resource constraints, alongside critical project assumptions.
6. **Detail Data & AI-Specific Considerations:** Specify data needs for AI, data quality/availability, privacy/security measures, and AI model explainability/ethics.
7. **Note Initial Technical & Architectural Thoughts:** High-level ideas on platform, deployment, and non-functional requirements.
8. **Record Alternatives Considered:** Briefly document other solutions considered and why the proposed one was chosen.

**Output:** ProjectInception.apml (containing detailed, structured answers to the inception questions).

### Integration With Main Framework
- The ProjectInception.apml artifact serves as a primary input for Phase 0.2 (Establish project context and domain) and Phase 1 (Project Registry Creation).

## Phase 0R: Rebuild Knowledge Capture (For Rebuild Projects)

### Purpose
Provides a structured process for capturing expert knowledge from previous project iterations before initiating a rebuild using the APML framework. This phase ensures hard-earned insights are preserved while enabling a clean implementation.

### Applicability Rules
- This phase is optional and only applicable to rebuild projects or projects heavily iterating on a direct predecessor.
- If a project is a rebuild, this phase should be executed before Phase 0 and Phase 1.
- Can be abbreviated for projects where time constraints are significant.

### Steps
1. **Expert Knowledge Session:** Conduct a structured session to capture expert knowledge about the current system's strengths, weaknesses, and critical design decisions.
   - **Output:** ExpertKnowledge.apml
2. **Previous Implementation Assessment:** High-level assessment of the previous implementation, focusing on identifying technical debt sources and opportunities for improvement.
   - **Output:** ImplementationAssessment.apml
3. **Rebuild Requirements Definition:** Define clear requirements for the rebuilt system based on learnings from the previous implementation.
   - **Output:** RebuildRequirements.apml
4. **Knowledge Integration Strategy:** Create a strategy for integrating captured knowledge into the APML-driven rebuild process.
   - **Output:** KnowledgeIntegrationStrategy.apml

### Integration With Main Framework
- Artifacts from Phase 0R serve as primary inputs for Phase 0.2 and Phase 1 for rebuild projects.
- All components should be validated against the RebuildRequirements.apml in addition to standard validation criteria.

```

### Component Organization

Components should be organized into their own directories with standardized file structure:

#### UI Components (`/src/components/ComponentName/`)
- `ComponentName.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `ComponentName.test.tsx` - Component tests
- `ComponentNameExample.tsx` - Usage examples
- `componentName.css` - Component styles (if needed)
- `ComponentName.README.md` - Component documentation
- `index.ts` - Exports for the component

#### Engine Components (`/src/engines/ComponentName/`)
- `ComponentName.ts` - Main implementation
- `ComponentNameTypes.ts` - Type definitions
- `ComponentName.test.ts` - Component tests
- `ComponentNameExample.ts` - Usage examples
- `ComponentName.README.md` - Component documentation
- `index.ts` - Exports for the component

### File Naming Conventions

- **README Files**: Each component directory should have a `ComponentName.README.md` file.
- **Interface Files**: Interface definitions should be named `ComponentNameInterface.apml`.
- **Development Session Files**: Development sessions should be named `ComponentName.DevelopmentSession.apml`.
- **Implementation Package Files**: Implementation packages should be named `ComponentName_Implementation_Package.md`.
- **Visual Test Files**: Simple HTML tests should be named `ComponentName-test.html`.

## Project Registry

The project registry (registry.apml) is the single source of truth for what needs to be built. It is stored at the project root and contains:

1. Project purpose and scope
2. Module definitions
3. Component specifications
4. Implementation status
5. Validation criteria
6. Module interactions

## Version Control Integration

The APML Framework supports optional version control integration to track changes and facilitate collaboration:

### Simple GitHub Integration

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Use GitHub Desktop for a user-friendly interface
   - Initialize repository in the project root
   - Add a basic `.gitignore` file for common exclusions

2. **Basic Workflow**:
   - Make changes to project files
   - Commit changes with clear descriptions
   - Push to GitHub when ready to share or backup

3. **Branch Strategy** (Optional):
   - `main` branch for stable, working code
   - Feature branches for new components or major changes

### Benefits for Non-Coders

- **History**: Tracks all changes to project files
- **Safety**: Provides backups and ability to revert changes
- **Collaboration**: Makes sharing and reviewing code easier
- **Transparency**: Documents who made which changes and why

## Component Testing for Non-Coders

The APML Framework emphasizes simple testing approaches accessible to non-coders:

### HTML-Based Component Testing

1. **Create Simple HTML Test Files**:
   - One HTML file per component in `/tests/visual/`
   - Include necessary CSS and JavaScript files
   - Minimal setup to instantiate and test the component

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Basic HTML page that loads the component
   - Simple controls to test different component states
   - Visual verification of component behavior

3. **Usage**:
   - Open the HTML file directly in a browser
   - No build tools or servers required
   - Refresh to see changes after modifying component code

### Example Test File Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ComponentName Test</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../src/components/ComponentName/componentName.css">
    <style>
        /* Test page styling */
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; padding: 20px; }
        .container { max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>ComponentName Test</h1>
        <div id="component-container"></div>
        <div class="controls">
            <!-- Test controls -->
        </div>
    </div>

    <script src="../../src/components/ComponentName/ComponentName.js"></script>
    <script>
        // Test initialization and control logic
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Component Relationship Visualization

The APML Framework now includes a visual mapping document to clarify component relationships:

### Framework Relationships Document

The `framework_relationships.md` file provides a visual representation of:

1. **Module Structure**: High-level module organization
2. **Interface-Component Relationships**: Which components implement which interfaces
3. **Component Dependencies**: How components depend on each other
4. **Cross-Module Interactions**: How modules interact with each other

### Visualization Format

The document uses simple markdown-based visualization with:

- ASCII box diagrams for module structure
- Indented lists for interface-component relationships
- Connection diagrams for cross-module interactions

## Fractal Patterns

The framework maintains its fractal nature through:

### 1. Context-Interface-Implementation (CII) Triangle

Every development entity exists within a CII triangle:

```
           Context
            /   \
           /     \
     Interface---Implementation
```

- **Context:** Why it exists and how it relates to the whole
- **Interface:** How it communicates with other entities
- **Implementation:** How it fulfills its responsibilities

This triangle is preserved at all scales, creating a fractal structure that maintains consistency while allowing for appropriate complexity at each level.

### 2. Recursive Documentation Structure

Documentation follows a recursive structure where each level contains the same elements but with appropriate detail for that level.

### 3. LLM-Aware Structural Patterns

The framework explicitly incorporates understanding of how LLMs function:

- **Context Window Management:** Explicit mechanisms for managing token limits
- **Information Retention Patterns:** Structures that optimize for LLM memory characteristics
- **Prompt Construction Templates:** Standardized formats optimized for AI comprehension
- **Implementation Unit Sizing:** Component boundaries designed to fit LLM processing capacity
- **Error Recovery Protocols:** Systematic approaches to addressing AI misunderstandings

## APML-First Approach

Standard APML serves as the single source of truth for all framework objects, with automated conversion to other formats:

### 1. Standard APML (Storage & Documentation)
- Complete XML representation
- Authoritative source for all framework objects
- Used for storage, documentation, and tools

### 2. Markdown APML (Human Readability)
- Generated from Standard APML
- Used for human review and verification
- Preserves all essential information in readable format

### 3. Token-Optimized APML (AI Sessions)
- Generated from Standard APML
- Compact representation for AI session contexts
- Optimized for token efficiency while preserving semantics

### Example: Standard APML vs. Token-Optimized APML

**Standard APML (Storage & Documentation)**
```xml
<Component name="TokenManager" module="Authentication">
  <Purpose>
    Generates and validates authentication tokens
  </Purpose>
  <ContextBoundary size="small" tokenEstimate="5000">
  </ContextBoundary>
  <Interfaces>
    <Interface name="generateToken">
      <Input name="userId" type="string" required="true" />
      <Output name="token" type="string" />
    </Interface>
  </Interfaces>
  <ValidationCriteria>
    <Criterion id="SEC001" test="tests/security/token_tamper_test.js">
      Tokens must be cryptographically secure and tamper-evident
    </Criterion>
  </ValidationCriteria>
</Component>
```

**Token-Optimized APML (AI Sessions)**
```xml
<C name="TokenManager" module="Authentication" 
   purpose="Generates and validates authentication tokens"
   contextSize="small" tokens="5000">
  <I name="generateToken">
    <In name="userId" type="string" req="1" />
    <Out name="token" type="string" />
  </I>
  <V id="SEC001" test="tests/security/token_tamper_test.js">
    Tokens must be cryptographically secure and tamper-evident
  </V>
</C>
```

## Context Efficiency: Eliminating "Context Slop"

A critical aspect of effective AI-assisted development is minimizing "context slop" - unnecessary information that consumes valuable context window space without providing tangible benefits.

### Context Slop Detection

Common sources of context slop include:
- Redundant Documentation - Repeating the same explanation or context in multiple prompts
- Over-detailed Historical Context - Including complete conversation history when only the latest decisions matter
- Excessive Code Duplication - Sending entire codebases when only specific files are relevant
- Unrelated References - Including references to components not directly related to the current task
- Verbose Setup Information - Repeating environment and configuration details in every prompt

### Slop Elimination Strategies

#### 1. Context Relevance Filtering

Before each AI interaction, apply strict relevance filtering:
```yaml
relevant_context:
  - current_component_only: true
  - direct_dependencies_only: true
  - implementation_details: false  # Only send interfaces
  - historical_decisions:
      max_age: 1  # Only include decisions from current session
      max_count: 3  # Only most recent 3 decisions
```

#### 2. Context Compression Techniques

Apply compression techniques to reduce token usage:
- Reference Summarization: Replace complete component descriptions with summaries and interfaces
- Code Skeleton Mode: Send only function signatures and critical comments, not implementations
- Dependency Bridging: Only include direct dependencies, not the entire dependency chain
- Decision Distillation: Compress decision history into outcome statements

#### 3. Session-Specific Context

For each session type, define a minimal context profile:
```yaml
context_profiles:
  implementation:
    includes:
      - target_component_interface
      - direct_dependencies_interfaces
      - implementation_standards
      - test_criteria
    excludes:
      - other_components_implementation
      - historical_conversations
      - unrelated_modules
      
  bugfix:
    includes:
      - buggy_component_implementation
      - reproduction_steps
      - relevant_tests
      - error_logs
    excludes:
      - unaffected_components
      - historical_development_context
```

#### 4. Context Budget Enforcement

Strictly enforce context budgets with hard limits:
```yaml
context_budget:
  total_max: 200000  # token limit
  allocation:
    project_context: 20000  # Just 10% for project context
    component_interfaces: 30000  # 15% for interfaces
    implementation_space: 130000  # 65% for actual implementation
    response_space: 20000  # 10% reserved for response
  enforcement: 
    action: "truncate"  # Automatically truncate if over budget
    priority: "newest_first"  # Keep newest information
```

#### 5. Targeted Reference Loading

Replace blanket inclusion with targeted references:
```xml
<References>
  <Load id="AuthComponent.Interface" />
  <Load id="UserModel.Interface" />
  <!-- Do NOT load entire codebase -->
</References>
```

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Philosophy

The testing approach is guided by the following principles:

1. **Distinction-Based Validation**: All components must be validated through explicit test-linked criteria, following Axiom 5 of the Fractal framework.

2. **Dual Validation Approach**: Combining automated testing for objective criteria with human evaluation for subjective aspects.

3. **Progressive Verification**: Testing occurs at multiple stages of development rather than only at the end.

4. **Interface-First Testing**: Tests validate that implementations fulfill their interface contracts.

5. **Context-Aware Evaluation**: Tests consider the component's purpose and context within the larger system.

### Testing Approaches

Four complementary testing approaches, each with specific applications:

#### 1. Component-Level Testing with Mock Data

**Description**: Testing individual components in isolation using mock data based on interface contracts.

**When to Use**:
- During Phase 3 (Component Implementation)
- When validating that a component meets its interface requirements
- For rapid feedback during development

**Implementation**:
- Unit tests written alongside component implementation
- Mock data generated based on interface contracts
- Tests run automatically after component integration

**Advantages**:
- Immediate feedback on component functionality
- Precise identification of issues
- Focused testing of specific functionality

**Limitations**:
- Doesn't validate component interactions
- Mock data may not represent real-world scenarios

#### 2. Progressive Testing in Development Environment

**Description**: Testing components in a controlled environment as they are developed, with incremental integration.

**When to Use**:
- After completing related components that interact with each other
- When validating component interactions
- For testing user flows that span multiple components

**Implementation**:
- Integration tests that exercise multiple components
- Test environment with controlled data
- Automated test scripts with manual verification of results

**Advantages**:
- Validates component interactions
- Identifies integration issues early
- Allows for incremental testing of the system

**Limitations**:
- More complex test setup
- May require partial mocking of unimplemented components

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Phase After Module Completion

**Description**: Dedicated testing phase after completing all components in a module, using structured test scenarios.

**When to Use**:
- After Phase 3 (Component Implementation) for a module is complete
- Before Phase 4 (Integration and Validation)
- When validating that a module fulfills its purpose

**Implementation**:
- End-to-end tests for module functionality
- Structured test scenarios based on module requirements
- Combination of automated tests and manual verification

**Advantages**:
- Comprehensive validation of module functionality
- Tests real user scenarios within the module
- Validates that the module fulfills its purpose

**Limitations**:
- Delayed feedback on issues
- May be difficult to isolate issues to specific components

#### 4. End-to-End Testing After System Completion

**Description**: Testing the complete system after all modules are implemented, with extensive logging for issue identification.

**When to Use**:
- After Phase 4 (Integration and Validation)
- During Phase 5 (Reflection and Refinement)
- For final validation of the system

**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive end-to-end tests
- Real-world test scenarios
- Extensive logging for issue identification
- User acceptance testing

**Advantages**:
- Validates the complete system
- Tests real-world scenarios
- Identifies issues that only appear in the full system

**Limitations**:
- Latest feedback on issues
- Complex issue isolation
- Resource-intensive

### Recommended Testing Strategy

A combined approach that leverages the strengths of each testing method:

#### Phase 3: Component Implementation

1. **Component-Level Testing (Automated)**
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Validation against interface contracts
   - Automated tests run after implementation
   - Test reports included in DevelopmentSession.apml

2. **Subjective Evaluation (Manual)**
   - Human review of UI components
   - Evaluation against subjective criteria
   - Documentation of findings
   - Feedback incorporated into implementation

#### Phase 4: Integration and Validation

1. **Module Integration Testing (Automated + Manual)**
   - Integration tests for module functionality
   - Validation against module purpose
   - Combination of automated and manual testing
   - Test reports included in IntegrationSession.apml

2. **Cross-Module Testing (Automated + Manual)**
   - Tests for interactions between modules
   - Validation of critical paths
   - Focus on boundary conditions
   - Documentation of issues

#### Phase 5: Reflection and Refinement

1. **System Testing (Automated + Manual)**
   - End-to-end tests for complete system
   - Validation against project purpose
   - Extensive logging for issue identification
   - User acceptance testing

2. **Performance and Stress Testing (Automated)**
   - Load testing for performance
   - Stress testing for stability
   - Validation of non-functional requirements
   - Documentation of results

### Objective vs. Subjective Criteria

#### Objective Criteria (Automated Testing)

Objective criteria are measurable, deterministic aspects that can be verified through automated testing:

1. **Functional Correctness**
   - Component behaves according to its interface contract
   - All methods return expected results for given inputs
   - Error handling works as specified

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Performance meets specified thresholds
   - Accessibility requirements are met
   - Browser compatibility requirements are met

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - Components interact correctly with other components
   - Data flows correctly between components
   - System behavior is consistent across components

#### Subjective Criteria (Manual Evaluation)

Subjective criteria require human judgment and cannot be fully automated:

1. **User Experience**
   - Interface is intuitive and easy to use
   - Visual design is appealing and appropriate
   - Interactions feel natural and responsive

2. **Educational Effectiveness**
   - Content presentation supports learning objectives
   - Feedback is helpful and motivational
   - Progression feels appropriate and engaging

3. **Emotional Impact**
   - Experience is calming and non-anxiety-inducing
   - Achievements feel rewarding and meaningful
   - Overall experience is engaging and motivational

### Validation Framework

To ensure consistent evaluation, a structured validation framework is used:

#### Component Validation Matrix

Each component is validated against a matrix of criteria:

| Criterion Type | Examples | Validation Method | Documentation |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Interface Compliance | Methods implement specified behavior | Automated tests | Test reports |
| Functional Requirements | Component performs required functions | Automated tests | Test reports |
| Technical Requirements | Performance, accessibility, compatibility | Automated tests | Test reports |
| User Experience | Usability, visual design, interactions | Manual evaluation | Evaluation reports |
| Educational Effectiveness | Learning support, feedback quality | Manual evaluation | Evaluation reports |
| Emotional Impact | Anxiety reduction, engagement | Manual evaluation | Evaluation reports |

#### Validation Levels

Validation occurs at multiple levels:

1. **Component Level**
   - Validation against component interface and requirements
   - Documented in DevelopmentSession.apml

2. **Module Level**
   - Validation against module purpose and requirements
   - Documented in IntegrationSession.apml

3. **System Level**
   - Validation against project purpose and requirements
