# Fractal Framework Definition

This directory contains all APML Framework definition files and artifacts for the Zenjin Maths App rebuild project.

## Directory Structure

- `current/`: Contains the current version of the Fractal Framework
- `archive/`: Contains previous versions of the Fractal Framework
- `interfaces/`: Contains interface definitions for all components
- `phase0r/`: Contains Rebuild Knowledge Capture artifacts
- `phase1/`: Contains Project Registry (legacy location)
- `phase2/`: Contains module definitions
- `phase3/`: Contains development sessions

## Framework Evolution

The Fractal Framework is continuously evolving to better support AI-assisted development. The current version is stored in the `current/` directory, while previous versions are archived in the `archive/` directory.

## Interface-First Development

Following Axiom 2 (Interface Before Implementation), all components must have a clearly defined interface before implementation begins. These interfaces are stored in the `interfaces/` directory as APML files.

## Module Definitions

The `phase2/` directory contains module definitions that group related components and define module boundaries. These definitions help ensure that components have clear responsibilities and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Development Sessions

The `phase3/` directory contains development session records that document the implementation process for each component. These records provide valuable context for future development and help maintain consistency across the project.
