  critical_issues:
    factRepository_method_missing:
      error: "TypeError: this.factRepository.factExists is not a function"
      impact: "Sessions end prematurely after each question"
      location: "DistinctionManager validation in updateBoundaryLevel"
      
    navigation_architecture:
      problem: "LearningSession takes over entire screen, no app navbar"
      attempted_fix: "Restructured Auth-to-Player flow but violated APML principles"
      current_state: "Mixed concerns between layout and component logic"
      
    stitch_progression:
      problem: "No progression to next stitch after completing 20 questions"
      cause: "Missing integration between session completion and stitch progression"
      impact: "Users stuck in single stitch loop"

browser_logs_analysis:
  positive_signals:
    - "✅ FactRepository: Facts initialized successfully"
    - "✅ Anonymous user session created (Online mode)"
    - "LearningSession initialized from bus with full session data: 20 questions"
    - "✅ Session metrics recorded to backend"
    - "Response processed: correct"
    
  error_patterns:
    - "[LearningEngineService] Failed to update user mastery: TypeError: this.factRepository.factExists is not a function"
    - "Unable to generate next question, ending session"
    - "Learning session completed" (premature)
    
  concerning_behavior:
    - "Multiple re-initializations of LearningSession"
    - "Constant phase checks and re-renders"
    - "authToPlayerState stuck in ACTIVE_LEARNING"

architectural_violations:
  separation_of_concerns:
    violation: "Auth-to-Player flow mixed with app layout logic"
    impact: "Components know too much about their container"
    fix_needed: "Clean separation between content generation and layout"
    
  interface_contracts:
    violation: "Implementation changes without interface updates"
    examples:
      - "FactRepository missing factExists method"
      - "Question interface mismatch (distractor vs distractors)"
      - "PlayerCard props inconsistency"
    
  documentation_drift:
    violation: "Code changes without documentation updates"
    impact: "Lost track of what was changed and why"

recommended_approach:
  immediate_fixes:
    1_factExists_method:
      priority: "critical"
      action: "Add factExists method to FactRepository interface and implementation"
      rationale: "Blocking all learning progression"
      
    2_navigation_architecture:
      priority: "high"
      action: "Properly separate Auth-to-Player content from app layout"
      approach: |
        - Auth-to-Player should only generate content
        - App should handle all layout/navigation
        - Use proper state management for current view
        
    3_stitch_progression:
      priority: "high"
      action: "Connect session completion to stitch progression logic"
      components_involved:
        - "EngineOrchestrator.completeStitch()"
        - "CurriculumMapper.rotateToNextTube()"
        - "SpacedRepetitionSystem.repositionStitch()"

  architectural_refactoring:
    principle: "Follow APML v2.2 interface-first development"
    steps:
      1: "Document current interfaces in YAML"
      2: "Identify interface violations"
      3: "Update interfaces to match intended behavior"
      4: "Refactor implementations to match interfaces"
      5: "Test with proper separation of concerns"

housekeeping_tasks:
  documentation:
    - "Convert all .apml files to .yaml format"
    - "Update registry with actual component states"
    - "Create session reports for debugging work"
    - "Document architectural decisions"
    
  code_cleanup:
    - "Remove all debug console.log statements"
    - "Clean up temporary fixes and hacks"
    - "Standardize error handling"
    - "Remove duplicate code"
    
  testing:
    - "Create integration tests for Auth-to-Player flow"
    - "Test stitch progression logic"
    - "Verify all interfaces match implementations"

next_session_priorities:
  1: "Fix factExists error to restore learning progression"
  2: "Implement proper navigation architecture following APML"
  3: "Connect stitch progression for continuous learning"
  4: "Update all documentation to YAML format"
  5: "Clean up technical debt from debugging phase"

success_metrics:
  - "User can complete full 20-question stitch without errors"
  - "Navigation shows properly during learning session"
  - "Completing stitch loads next stitch automatically"
  - "All documentation in YAML format and up-to-date"
  - "Clean separation between components and layout"

context_for_implementation:
  app_structure:
    current: "Mixed concerns, Auth-to-Player knows about layout"
    target: "Clean layers: App (layout) → Auth-to-Player (flow) → Components (UI)"
    
  state_management:
    current: "Complex state checks, multiple re-renders"
    target: "Single source of truth for app state, clean transitions"
    
  component_boundaries:
    current: "Fuzzy boundaries, components doing too much"
    target: "Each component has single responsibility"

final_notes:
  - "Previous debugging made progress but created technical debt"
  - "Need to balance fixing immediate issues with proper architecture"
  - "YAML-only documentation going forward (APML v2.2 standard)"
  - "Focus on sustainable, maintainable solutions"
  - "Trust in refactoring capability but follow APML protocols strictly"
