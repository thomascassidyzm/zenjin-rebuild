I've implemented the TripleHelixManager component for the Zenjin Maths App according to the provided specifications. This implementation includes all the required functionality for managing three parallel learning paths and their rotation following the Live Aid Stage Model.
What I've Created

TripleHelixManager Implementation - This is the core implementation file that contains the full TripleHelixManager class with all required methods and error handling.
Type Definitions - A separate file with all the necessary TypeScript interfaces and types that define the data structures.
Tests - Comprehensive test cases that validate the implementation against the requirements, with a focus on the critical validation criteria (PS-001 and PS-005).
Usage Example - A detailed example showing how to use the TripleHelixManager in a real application, including integration within a classroom context.

Key Features of the Implementation

Triple Helix Model Implementation

Maintains three distinct learning paths (tubes) per user
Implements the Live Aid Stage Model with one active and two preparing paths
Supports smooth path rotation with proper state transitions


Independent Adaptation

Each learning path has its own difficulty level (1-5)
Difficulty changes are properly persisted and don't affect other paths
Supports personalized progression across different mathematical concepts


Robust Error Handling

Custom error types for clear error identification
Comprehensive validation of inputs
Proper handling of edge cases


State Management

Tracks which path is active and which are being prepared
Maintains rotation history and counts
Provides complete state access and path-specific information



Implementation Details

The implementation uses TypeScript for type safety and includes comprehensive comments explaining the code.
It follows the Triple Helix learning model principles, optimizing cognitive resource usage through varied learning experiences.
The component integrates with the overall ProgressionSystem module of the Zenjin Maths App.
Although this is a standalone implementation, it shows how it would interface with other components like the StitchManager.

In a real-world scenario, you would connect this implementation to your database or storage system rather than using the in-memory storage that's included for demonstration purposes.
