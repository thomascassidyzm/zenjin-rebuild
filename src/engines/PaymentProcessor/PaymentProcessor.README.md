# PaymentProcessor Component for Zenjin Maths App

## Overview

This implementation of the PaymentProcessor component for the Zenjin Maths App handles payment processing for premium subscriptions. The component securely processes payments, manages payment history, and handles refund operations while adhering to PCI DSS compliance standards.

## Files Structure

The component is organized into multiple files for better maintainability:

1. **PaymentProcessorTypes.ts** - Interfaces and type definitions
2. **PaymentProcessorErrors.ts** - Standardized error codes
3. **PaymentProcessorUtils.ts** - Utility functions for IDs, timestamps, and formatting
4. **PaymentProcessorLogger.ts** - Logging implementation
5. **PaymentProcessorValidators.ts** - Payment details and refund validation
6. **PaymentGatewayAdapter.ts** - Implementation of payment gateway adapters (Stripe and PayPal)
7. **PaymentRepository.ts** - Implementation of in-memory and database repositories
8. **PaymentProcessor.ts** - Core implementation of the payment processing logic
9. **index.ts** - Main exports and factory function for creating the PaymentProcessor
10. **PaymentProcessorExample.ts** - Example usage of the component

## Core Features

- **Secure Payment Processing**: Using tokenization to comply with PCI DSS standards
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support for credit/debit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay
- **Comprehensive Payment History**: Detailed tracking of all payment transactions
- **Refund Processing**: Handling refunds with policy enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various scenarios
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

## Design Patterns

The implementation uses several design patterns:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: For payment gateway integration, allowing easy support for different payment providers
2. **Repository Pattern**: For data storage abstraction, supporting both in-memory and database storage
3. **Factory Pattern**: For creating gateway adapters and repositories with appropriate configurations
4. **Dependency Injection**: For better testability and flexibility

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create a payment processor with in-memory repository and Stripe gateway
const paymentProcessor = createPaymentProcessor({
  repositoryType: 'memory',
  repositoryConfig: {
    existingUsers: ['user123']
  },
  defaultGateway: 'card',
  gatewayConfig: {
    stripeApiKey: 'sk_test_example'
  }
});

// Process a payment
const userId = 'user123';
const paymentDetails = {
  method: 'card',
  amount: 4.99,
  currency: 'USD',
  methodDetails: {
    token: 'tok_visa',
    lastFour: '4242',
    expiryMonth: 12,
    expiryYear: 2025
  },
  metadata: {
    planId: 'premium-monthly'
  }
};

// Process the payment
const result = await paymentProcessor.processPayment(userId, paymentDetails);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Payment successful! Payment ID: ${result.paymentId}`);
  
  // Get payment history
  const history = await paymentProcessor.getPaymentHistory(userId);
  
  // Process a refund if needed
  const refundReason = 'Customer request - changed mind';
  const refundResult = await paymentProcessor.refundPayment(result.paymentId, refundReason);
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Payment Gateway Integration

The PaymentProcessor uses the adapter pattern to integrate with payment gateways:

- **StripeGatewayAdapter**: For card payments, Apple Pay, and Google Pay
- **PayPalGatewayAdapter**: For PayPal payments

The implementation is designed to easily add support for additional payment gateways by implementing the `PaymentGatewayAdapter` interface.

### Data Storage

Two repository implementations are provided:

- **InMemoryPaymentRepository**: For testing and development
- **DatabasePaymentRepository**: For production use with a database

### Security Considerations

The implementation follows PCI DSS compliance requirements:

- No sensitive payment data is stored
- All payment processing uses tokenization
- Payment data is transmitted securely
- Proper error handling and logging

### Error Handling

Standardized error codes are used throughout:

- `USER_NOT_FOUND`: When the specified user was not found
- `INVALID_PAYMENT_DETAILS`: When payment details are invalid
- `PAYMENT_PROCESSING_FAILED`: When payment processing failed
- `PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND`: When a payment was not found
- `REFUND_FAILED`: When a refund operation failed
- `ALREADY_REFUNDED`: When a payment has already been refunded
- `REFUND_WINDOW_EXPIRED`: When the refund window has expired

## Next Steps for Implementation

To use this implementation in a production environment:

1. **Select a Payment Gateway**: Choose and configure a real payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
2. **Implement Database Storage**: Connect to a real database for persistent storage
3. **Configure Security**: Ensure proper security measures are in place for PCI DSS compliance
4. **Testing**: Perform thorough testing with the payment gateway's sandbox environment
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for payment processing

## Testing

The implementation was designed with testability in mind. In a real-world scenario, you would want to:

1. Write unit tests for all components
2. Write integration tests for payment gateway interactions
3. Test edge cases like network failures and service unavailability
4. Test security aspects

## Conclusion

This implementation of the PaymentProcessor component provides a solid foundation for secure payment processing in the Zenjin Maths App. It follows best practices for security, error handling, and architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend in the future.
