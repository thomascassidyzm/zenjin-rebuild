# Zenjin Maths Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Zenjin Maths adaptive learning system.

## 🎯 Vision

Zenjin Maths implements "Netflix for Maths" - providing zero decision fatigue learning through distinction-based mastery. The system uses dynamic content generation, treating stitches as recipes rather than static question banks.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

- **[Architecture Overview](architecture.html)** - Core system design and philosophy
- **[Data Flows](data-flows.html)** - Detailed descriptions of all system data flows
- **[Flow Diagrams](diagrams.html)** - Visual representations of data flows
- **[Data Structures](data-structures.html)** - Complete reference for implementation
- **[System Interfaces](interfaces.html)** - Component connections and contracts

## 🚀 Key Innovations

1. **Dynamic Content Generation** - Questions generated just-in-time from recipes
2. **Sparse Position Management** - Infinite scaling through logical/physical separation
3. **Distinction-Based Learning** - 5 levels of increasing difficulty
4. **Triple Helix Model** - Automatic rotation between learning modes
5. **Spaced Repetition** - Unique skip number algorithm [4, 8, 15, 30, 100, 1000]

## 🏗️ Getting Started

Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture.html) to understand the system design, then explore the [Data Flows](data-flows.html) to see how everything connects.
