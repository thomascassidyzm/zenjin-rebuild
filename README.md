# Zenjin Maths App Rebuild

## Vision: Netflix for Maths

**A single-stream, adaptive mathematics learning platform built on distinction-based learning theory with zero decision fatigue for learners.**

This project is a complete architectural rebuild of the Zenjin Maths App using the APML Framework v1.4.2, implementing a scientifically-grounded approach to mathematical learning that adapts invisibly to each user's cognitive development.

## Core Learning Philosophy: Distinction as Primitive

### The Foundation
Learning happens through **distinction formation** - the ability to draw boundaries between "this" and "not-this." Every mathematical concept emerges from increasingly refined boundary-making capabilities under energy constraints.

### Why Traditional Math Education Fails
- **Explanation-first approach** violates how the brain actually learns
- **Cognitive overload** from trying to teach concepts through language
- **Energy inefficiency** from forcing conscious calculation over pattern recognition
- **One-size-fits-all** ignoring individual distinction formation rates

### The Zenjin Approach
- **Zero-explanation learning** through pure comparison opportunities
- **Progressive boundary refinement** from gross to subtle distinctions
- **Automatic intuition formation** through pattern recognition development
- **Energy-optimized** adaptive content generation

## Architecture: Clean Separation for Infinite Adaptability

### Three-Layer Design

**1. App Layer (Simple & Stable)**
```typescript
// App only knows: "Give me content for this stitch"
const content = await getStitchContent('t1-0007-0023');
// Gets back: Optimized questions (could be 20, 10, 5, whatever is best)
```

**2. State Layer (User's Learning Journey)**
```typescript
// Tracks WHERE user is and HOW they're progressing
interface UserLearningState {
  tubes: { tube1: PositionMap, tube2: PositionMap, tube3: PositionMap };
  activeTube: TubeId;
  stitchProgress: Record<StitchId, Progress>;
}
```

**3. Content Layer (Hidden Sophistication)**
```typescript
// All the AI/adaptation magic happens here - invisible to the app
// Same stitch ID produces different content as user evolves:
// Week 1: 20 basic questions
// Week 10: 10 optimized questions focusing on weak spots  
// Week 50: 5 maintenance questions for boundary preservation
```

### The Genius: Evolutionary Architecture
- **Ship simple, working system immediately**
- **Add infinite AI sophistication without changing the app**
- **A/B test learning algorithms without UI changes**
- **Scale from basic to world-class without rewrites**

## Triple Helix Learning System

### Live Aid Stage Model
- **3 Tubes** acting as containers with position slots
- **Live Aid rotation**: PLAYING ‚Üí READY ‚Üí PREPARING
- **Background preparation** ensures seamless flow
- **No decision fatigue** for learners

### Positions as First-Class Citizens
```
Tube 1: Position 1: [Stitch A], Position 4: [Stitch B], Position 15: [Stitch C]
Tube 2: Position 1: [Stitch D], Position 8: [Stitch E], Position 30: [Stitch F]
Tube 3: Position 1: [Stitch G], Position 2: [Stitch H], Position 100: [Stitch I]
```

### Spaced Repetition with Compression
- **Skip sequence**: [4, 8, 15, 30, 100, 1000] 
- **Logical positions** can exceed stitch count
- **Real-time compression** during state sync
- **Retirement at position 1000** for monthly review

## Stitch System: Atomic Learning Units

### Enhanced Stitch IDs: tX-YYYY-ZZZZ
- **X**: Tube number (1, 2, 3)
- **YYYY**: Concept code (0001-9999, tube-specific)
- **ZZZZ**: Creation order within concept (0001-9999)
- **Capacity**: 299,970,003 total possible stitches

### Parameterized Content Generation
**Not fixed containers, but adaptive recipes:**
```typescript
StitchParameters = {
  conceptId: '7x_table',
  questionCount: 20,          // Adapts: 20 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 5
  difficultyRange: [1, 20],   // Adapts: [1,20] ‚Üí [5,15] ‚Üí [8,12]
  boundaryLevel: 3,           // Ratchets: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
  adaptiveBehaviors: { ... }  // Infinite customization potential
}
```

## User State: Personal Learning Journey

### Netflix-Style Personalization
```typescript
// Anonymous users: Always same default state (fast onboarding)
defaultState = {
  tube1: { 1: 't1-0001-0001', 2: 't1-0001-0002', ... }
  tube2: { 1: 't2-0001-0001', 2: 't2-0001-0002', ... }
  tube3: { 1: 't3-0001-0001', 2: 't3-0001-0002', ... }
}

// Registered users: Completely personalized based on their performance
personalizedState = {
  tube1: { 1: 't1-0007-0023', 4: 't1-0001-0001', 15: 't1-0012-0008', ... }
  // Scrambled by spaced repetition based on individual progress
}
```

### Session Flow
1. **Auth** ‚Üí Load user state (tube position maps)
2. **Play** ‚Üí Background preparation using Live Aid model
3. **Adapt** ‚Üí Content adjusts invisibly based on distinction formation
4. **Session end** ‚Üí Compress positions + sync state
