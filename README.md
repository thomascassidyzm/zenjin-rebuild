# Zenjin Maths - Distinction-Based Learning Platform

## Vision & Human Objectives

**Transform how children learn mathematics** - from memorization to understanding, from frustration to joy, from individual struggle to supported growth.

### What We're Achieving for Humans

**For Children:**
- Mathematical confidence through understanding *why* things work
- Adaptive learning that meets them exactly where they are
- Joyful discovery rather than drill-and-practice drudgery
- Immediate success building toward complex understanding

**For Parents:**
- Peace of mind with transparent progress tracking
- Evidence their child is genuinely learning, not just memorizing
- Fair pricing model (free tier + premium unlock)
- Works anywhere - online, offline, any device

**For Educators:**
- Pedagogically sound distinction-based learning approach
- Detailed insights into each child's mathematical development
- Curriculum support that adapts to individual differences
- Evidence-based progress documentation

## Core Learning Philosophy

### Distinction-Based Learning
Instead of explaining concepts, we help children **build mathematical distinctions** - the ability to recognize patterns, relationships, and boundaries that make mathematics meaningful.

**Traditional Approach:** "7 + 5 = 12 because you count on from 7..."
**Zenjin Approach:** Present many examples where children discover the relationship through comparison and choice

### The Triple Helix Model
Learning spirals through three interleaving dimensions:
1. **Content Mastery** (addition â†’ subtraction â†’ multiplication â†’ division)
2. **Cognitive Complexity** (simple recognition â†’ pattern analysis â†’ strategic thinking)
3. **Personal Growth** (confidence building â†’ challenge seeking â†’ mathematical identity)
