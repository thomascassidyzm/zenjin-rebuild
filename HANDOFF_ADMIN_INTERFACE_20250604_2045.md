### Technical Architecture

**Claude Integration Structure:**
```typescript
interface ClaudeGenerationModal {
  existingStitches: StitchEssence[]
  existingFacts: Fact[]
  onImport: (content: GeneratedContent) => void
  // Claude will have full context awareness
}
```

**Key Features Designed:**
- Claude sees all existing content to avoid duplicates
- Gap analysis capabilities
- Bulk generation support
- Preview before import
- Follows established notation

### Next Steps

**Immediate Priority**: 
- User to add Claude Pro Max API key
- Test content generation with full context
- Refine prompts based on results

**Future Enhancements:**
- Server-side MCP for multi-user
- Export/import curriculum sets
- Version control for generated content

### Important File Modifications

### Session Insights

- User emphasized need for strategic thinking over implementation
- Agents successfully implemented all spawned briefs
- Claude integration designed for single-user initially
- Focus on context-aware content generation
- System now ready for Claude Pro Max integration

### Handoff Notes

The admin interface has evolved from basic CRUD to a sophisticated curriculum design studio. All visual and functional improvements are complete. The Claude integration UI is ready - just needs API key to become fully operational. Once connected, Claude will have full awareness of existing curriculum to generate non-duplicative, pedagogically sound content.

**Build Status**: Successfully building and deployed to Vercel  
**Runtime**: ~98% of context used  
**Session Achievement**: Admin interface transformed into premium curriculum design tool
