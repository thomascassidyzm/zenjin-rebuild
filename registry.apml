project_significance: |
  This modernized registry documents a complete architectural transformation 
  from a basic learning app to a sophisticated curriculum management platform.
  The implementation of flexible concept-to-tube mappings, fixed Triple Helix 
  rotation, and comprehensive Live Aid caching represents a major advancement 
  in educational technology architecture. The system now supports the L1 vision 
  of flexible curriculum design while maintaining scientific rigor in learning 
  progression.
