# Documentation Fixes Summary

## Overview
Based on reviewer feedback, the following documentation inconsistencies have been fixed to align with the Zenjin Maths architecture.

## 1. Distractor Pluralization Fixed

### Issue
Documentation inconsistently used "distractors" (plural) when the system implements binary choice questions with a single distractor.

### Files Fixed
1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Line 135: `distractors` → `distractor` in code example
   
2. **DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAMS.md**
   - Line 53: "Generate Distractors" → "Generate Distractor"
   
3. **DATA_FLOWS.md**
   - Section 3.2 title: "Generate Distractors Flow" → "Generate Distractor Flow"
   - Updated entire flow to reflect single distractor generation
   - Fixed question object structure to have single `distractor` field
   - Line 693: "Boundary Levels → Distractors" → "Boundary Levels → Distractor"
   
4. **SYSTEM_INTERFACE_DIAGRAM.md**
   - Line 85: `generateDistractors(fact,level)` → `generateDistractor(fact,level)`
   
5. **DATA_STRUCTURES_REFERENCE.md**
   - Updated test helper to generate binary choice questions with single distractor

## 2. Learning Paths → Stitches Terminology

### Issue
Some references incorrectly used "learning paths" instead of "stitches".

### Files Fixed
1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Line 5: "learning paths as recipes" → "stitches as recipes"
   
2. **README.md**
   - Line 137: "from learning paths to tube-based" → "from stitches to tube-based"
   
3. **index.md**
   - Line 7: "treating learning paths as recipes" → "treating stitches as recipes"

## 3. SessionManager Role Clarification

### Issue
SessionManager's role was unclear in the documentation.

### Enhancement Made
Added detailed explanation in **SYSTEM_INTERFACE_DIAGRAM.md**:
- New section "SessionManager Role & Responsibilities" (lines 163-173)
- Clarified its five key responsibilities:
  1. Session Initialization
  2. Question Management
  3. Answer Processing (FTC=3, EC=1)
  4. Session State
  5. Completion Handling
- Updated component table with clearer description

## Summary
All documentation now correctly reflects:
- Binary choice questions (1 correct answer + 1 distractor)
- Consistent "stitch" terminology
- Clear SessionManager orchestration role
- Proper points system (FTC=3, EC=1)

These fixes ensure the documentation accurately represents the system's architecture and implementation.
